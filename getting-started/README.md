# Section 4: Getting Started - Favorite Number

This is a simple interactive C++ program designed to practice basic Console Input/Output (I/O).

## 📝 Description
The program prompts the user to enter their favorite number between 1 and 100. It then reads the input and displays a friendly response, "claiming" that it shares the same favorite number.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
* Using `std::cout` to print text to the console.
* Using `std::cin` to read integer input from the user.
* Understanding the basic structure of a C++ program (`main` function).
* Basic use of `std::endl` for line breaks.

## 🛠 How to Build
To compile this specific file using g++, use:

`g++ main.cpp -o favorite_number`

`./favorite_number`
